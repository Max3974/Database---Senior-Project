# Database --- Senior-Project

## General Database Structure 
The current schema is based off of the RPPR question guide provided by the CCOM team. Each table represents each section of the report, with two additional tables for project management and login credentials. 

## Additional Structure 
For implementation with the website, in some fields a dropdown has been suggested. There are a few ways of going about storing a collection of data in SQL with one of them being simply making another table that connects to the section. I think it would be worth getting the foundation of the database created first, then seeing how it interacts with the site to see what solution would fit best.
